Different versions of the VEGAS multi-dimensional numerical integration routine used in High-Energy Physics calculations

I have made several verisons of this repository, I think this is going to be the final version.

It turns out that VEGAS written by "Numerical Recipes" is not open-sourced. So I'm not suppose to share their codes here on GitHub.
